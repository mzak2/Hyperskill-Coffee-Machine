# Hyperskill-Coffee-Machine
A project as part of the Hyperskill Java certification, where we are given a prompt to make a coffee machine, and build it from scratch.<br>

It is a simple text based machine, designed to emulate an embbedded program for a coffee machine. It runs entirely in console.<br>

You can view the source code in either CoffeeMachine.java, download the "Coffee MAchine" file for intellij, or download the CoffeeMachine.java.html to open in your browser for easy viewing.<br><br>

Example of finished version running:<br>
